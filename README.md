DIANA, Blockchain Lunar Registry.

The Diana project is birthed to decentralize ownership of the Moon through group participation of citizens and an issue of the Cosmic Crypto Currency to actualize the citizensâ€™ revolution of the common-heritage-of-mankind.

Diana Project is a way for us to gain back control and ownership of what is ours and not be side-lined.
